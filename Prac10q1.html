<!-- Write a script that moves a circle object (use the Ball class) up and down in a smooth bobbing motion.  

Note that the motion is in the y direction only, and should begin from - and oscillate around - the centre of the stage. The ball is fixed in the middle of the stage in the x direction. 
Try different values for the range (how far the ball moves).
Note that the angle variable should be incremented by a value (store it in a variable called yspeed) that is less than zero to maintain the smooth effect.  
Try setting to a higher value, and observe what happens. 

Note that we should use the following variables to move the ball:
angle, range, yspeed
